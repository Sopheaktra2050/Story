          My Mom’s Childhood 
  Mom is the second daughter among nine siblings. As a girl and the elder sister, mom took the responsibility for difficult tasks in her family. Mom was not sent to school until she reached nine since she had to help grandmother sell Num Ansorm( sticky rice cakes),Num Korng ( Cambodian donuts), fried bananas and yams at a primary school which was near her house. Even though mom had several brothers and sisters, they were not old enough to give grandma a hand or some didn’t care about household labor. And all of those stuffs such as preparing cake ingredients,making cakes, cooking, cleaning, doing the laundry were mom’s daily duty. She even had to carry two big tanks of water on her shoulders to fill several big containers at weekends while my big uncle was studying to become a teacher. More over, she sometimes occupied with feeding my two little aunts who were about two and four at that time. Mom could not sleep till the sunrise for she had to make sure that the cakes were all made to sell. Due to her tough life, mom decided to quit school when she was in grade 7. Mom could not pay much attention to her studies since those household chores always appeared first in her mind. She often fell asleep during class because of having to get up early to help grandma in the mornings. It is quite sure that mom had encountered with rugged life when she was young. As an adolescent , she should have experienced joyful life, but she didn’t. A am very grateful for what mom has done to me and the whole family.<!--

World Blood Donor Day is celebrated every year on the day of birthday anniversary of Karl Landsteiner on 14th of June in 1868. This event celebration was first started in the year 2004 aiming to raise the public awareness about the need for safe blood donation (including its products) voluntarily and unpaid by the healthy person. Blood donors are the key role player at this day as they donate life-saving gifts of blood to the needed person.
        
        It was first initiated and established to be celebrated annually on 14th of June by “the World Health Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies” in the year 2004. World Blood Donor Day was officially established by the WHO with its 192 Member States in the month of May in 2005 at the 58th World Health Assembly in order to motivate all the countries worldwide to thank the blood donors for their precious step, promote voluntary, safe and unpaid blood donations to ensure the sufficient blood supplies.
        World Blood Donor Day celebration brings a precious opportunity to all donors for celebrating it on national and global level as well as to commemorate the birthday anniversary of the Karl Landsteiner (a great scientist who won the Nobel Prize for his great discovery of the ABO blood group system).-->
