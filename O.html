          <blockquote style="font-size: 20px; padding-top: auto;">O negative is the most common blood type used for transfusions when the blood type is unknown.  This is why it is used most often in cases of trauma, emergency, surgery and any situation where blood type is unknown.  O negative is the universal blood type.
O negative blood type can only receive O negative blood.  
O negative donors who are CMV negative are known as Heroes for Babies at the Red Cross because it is the safest blood for transfusions for immune deficient newborns. Learn more about how you can be a Hero for a Baby.
Only 7% of the population have O negative  blood. Due to the its versatility for transfusions, it is in high demand.  In an emergency, it is the blood product of choice. For example, just one car accident victim can require up to 100 units of O neg. Meeting the demand for O negative blood is always a priority for the Red Cross. 

Type O positive blood is given to patients more than any other blood type, which is why it’s considered the most needed blood type.
38% of the population has O positive blood, making it the most common blood type.
O positive red blood cells are not universally compatible to all types, but they are compatible to any red blood cells that are positive (A+, B+, O+, AB+).
Over 80% of the population has a positive blood type and can receive O positive blood. That’s another reason it’s in such high demand.
In major traumas with massive blood loss, many hospitals transfuse O positive blood, even when the patient’s blood type is unknown. The risk of reaction is much lower in ongoing blood loss situations and O positive is more available than O negative. Type O positive blood is critical in trauma care.
Those with O positive blood can only receive transfusions from O positive or O negative blood types.

            <blockquote style="font-size: 20px; padding-top: auto;">Type O-People with type O blood fare best on intense physical exercise and animal proteins and less well on dairy products and grains, says Dr. D'Adamo. The leading reason for weight gain among Type O's is the gluten found in wheat products and, to a lesser extent, lentils, corn, kidney beans, and cabbage.
